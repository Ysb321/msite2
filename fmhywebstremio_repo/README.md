# FMHY's Website Streamer Addon for Stremio

Stremio Addon that serves video HTTP URLs from streaming websites listed by [FMHY](https://github.com/fmhy/FMHY/wiki/Streaming).

The addon keeps FMHY directory synchronization outside user requests. Maintenance jobs ingest the official video directory into a last-known-good local registry, classify candidates against bounded source-family fingerprints, run positive and negative health corpora, and record source-to-provider dependency edges. The runtime uses only sources with a successful validated extractability outcome and returns validated partial results within a hard deadline.

Requests consider every enabled, healthy source within the discovery deadline, with bounded concurrent lookups. Stream validation rotates across sources before trying their additional variants and continues through all discovered candidates within the overall deadline. Parallelism controls active requests, not the number of candidates checked or streams returned; failed variants do not consume a fixed result quota. Equivalent streams within a source are still deduplicated.

The extraction engine is organized around small tagged contracts:

```text
Stremio request
    -> source family
    -> resolver-owned host delegation
    -> HLS / DASH / direct-media inspection
    -> deterministic selection and deduplication
    -> Stremio response
```

Runtime sources come from the freshly audited FMHY registry. Every one-shot audit also generates the committed deployment registry, so the same passed sources are available on stateless hosts after the audit changes are committed. New integrations belong in focused source-family or host-extractor modules rather than route handlers. Sites absent from the current FMHY list or without fresh stream validation are not shipped.

## Development

Use the repository's mise-managed toolchain:

```sh
mise exec -- npm ci
mise exec -- npm run ci
mise exec -- npm run build
```

`npm run verify:contracts`, `npm run verify:diagnostics`, and `npm run verify:registry` provide focused architectural regression checks. The generated matcher registry is committed and verified in CI.

## Live extractability report

Run the opt-in live audit separately from deterministic CI tests:

```sh
mise exec -- npm run test:extractability
```

The audit fetches the FMHY video directory, freshly contacts every normalized entry, recognizes supported site families, and tests known positive and negative media cases through discovery, extraction, and fresh stream validation. Its JSON report preserves FMHY names, source IDs, domains, aliases, sections, tags, stage outcomes, and typed failures in `.data/extractability/report.json`, while runtime eligibility and health history are saved to `.data/extractability/sources.json`. Sources absent from the current directory are removed from the maintenance registry and health history. Passed sources are also written to `src/engine/registry/deployment-registry.generated.ts` for stateless deployment.

Provider dependency edges are saved to `.data/extractability/dependencies.json`. The report includes root-cause groups that connect a typed provider or protocol failure to every affected source.

An individual site failure is a report result rather than a test-process failure. The command exits successfully when at least one site produces a freshly validated stream and exits unsuccessfully when no site does. `extractable` and `degraded` report entries are runtime-eligible only when they contain at least one validated positive result. Recognition-only, discovery-only, failed, redirected, unreachable, blocked, inconclusive, unknown, unsupported, disabled, and untested entries are not exposed by the runtime.

The report keeps site disposition separate from extractability. `redirected` records include the observed final URL when a candidate resolves to an unrelated domain. `unreachable` records include timeout, DNS, connection, TLS, or equivalent probe failures. `blocked` distinguishes access denial or rate limiting from a site that appears down. `inconclusive` covers ambiguous recognition or an exhausted probe budget, while `unsupported` means the site responded successfully but did not match an implemented source family. Tested family cases retain their discovery, extraction, validation, and typed failure details.

The server loads the committed deployment registry and freshly validates its eligible sources during production startup. Persisted source health cannot override the shipped set or re-enable a source rejected at startup. Dependency edges reload every minute by default; `EXTRACTABILITY_RELOAD_INTERVAL_MS=0` disables that reload. Every production-healthy FMHY site is added to the configure page. The enabled or disabled value is encoded into that configured add-on URL and filters runtime source selection. The audit currently recognizes only source families implemented by this repository, so broad directory reporting does not imply broad extraction support.

The implemented reusable families include CinemaOS, CineGo, Cinetaro, 67Movies, P-Stream-compatible frontends, and Dooplay sites. CinemaOS uses exact TMDB-backed catalog pages and the Speedracelight architecture exposed through its configured Videasy player. CineGo and 67Movies share the VidsrcMe playback architecture while keeping their own exact catalog matching. P-Stream sites remain non-eligible when the provider architecture cannot find the known health-corpus media from the deployment network. Dooplay sites remain non-eligible when search discovery is incomplete or delegated players fail fresh validation. Browser-only anti-bot challenges, authenticated sites, client applications without a server-reproducible playback contract, and hosts that return expired media remain typed blocked, unsupported, failed, or inconclusive results rather than passes.

Movies To Watch uses the reusable TMDB embed catalog family. Discovery reads the frontend's current public catalog configuration, follows its exact title/type/ID search and movie-year matching, and checks series season and episode availability against the same catalog used by its player UI. Its explicitly configured Videasy provider reuses the Speedracelight host architecture. The health corpus covers Inception (2010), Breaking Bad S01E01, Breaking Bad S05E16, and a deterministic nonexistent title. Later-season matching does not confuse the series premiere year with the requested season's release year.

BingeBang uses the reusable BingeBang player family. Discovery matches its own multi-search catalog on exact title, media type, movie year, and available season count, then asks the player architecture for the exact requested season and episode; the site answers an out-of-range episode with a missing player page. The player architecture reads the ticket the play page issues, decrypts the counter-keystream envelope its source list and resolver return, and publishes every resolved server. Those hosts answer only to the site's own referrer, so their streams declare relayed delivery and reach viewers through the existing signed HLS relay. The health corpus covers Inception (2010), Breaking Bad S01E01, The Boys S02E01, and a deterministic nonexistent title, so a later season released after the series premiere year stays matchable.

AniCine uses its reusable catalog family and the CinePro host architecture. Discovery searches the site's TMDB catalog, checks movie titles and years or exact series seasons and episodes, then reads the current primary player URL from the watch application's assets. CinePro exchanges its public playback token and returns viewer-accessible HLS URLs and subtitle tracks. Subtitle metadata follows the canonical stream pipeline into Stremio. The health corpus includes Inception, Breaking Bad, The Boys season 2, Attack on Titan seasons 1 and 2, and a deterministic absent title. Anime uses the site's TMDB television catalog with Stremio season/episode numbering; AniList-only IDs and separate sub/dub selection are not introduced by this family.

SoapGo uses the reusable Soaper catalog family. Discovery searches its movie and television result sections, matches exact titles and movie years, and follows the requested episode from the series catalog. It reads the actual embedded player's configuration and checks the TMDB ID, media type, season, and episode before using the player's explicit VidsrcMe fallback through the existing host architecture and signed HLS relay. The Turnstile-protected resolver is not required for that fallback. The health corpus covers Inception (2010), Breaking Bad S01E01, The Boys S02E01, and a deterministic nonexistent title.

Run continuous maintenance with:

```sh
mise exec -- npm run maintain:extractability
```

Watch mode runs immediately and then every six hours. `EXTRACTABILITY_INTERVAL_MS` controls the maintenance interval, while `EXTRACTABILITY_REPROBE_INTERVAL_MS` controls how soon a previously classified candidate is eligible for a fresh family probe. The default candidate reprobe interval is 24 hours. A one-shot audit retains the requested aggregate exit rule; watch mode remains alive and reports each run even when a run has zero extractable sites.

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for the deployment and Stremio installation checks. The detailed implementation contract remains in [`blueprint/ARCHITECTURE.md`](blueprint/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`blueprint/PLAN.md`](blueprint/PLAN.md).
